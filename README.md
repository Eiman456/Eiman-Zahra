To implement and run the Remote Health Monitoring System in VS Code, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Java in VS Code
Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) (JDK 17 or later recommended).

Install the Java Extension Pack in VS Code:

Open VS Code → Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) → Search for "Java Extension Pack" → Install.

Step 2: Create a Java Project
Create a new folder for your project (e.g., RemoteHealthMonitoring).

Open the folder in VS Code.

Create a src directory inside the project folder (this will hold your Java files).

Step 3: Organize Classes
Create the following directory structure inside src for your classes (use packages for better organization):

src/
├── emergency_alert/
│   ├── EmergencyAlert.java
│   ├── PanicButton.java
│   └── NotificationService.java
├── chat_video/
│   ├── ChatServer.java
│   ├── ChatClient.java
│   └── VideoCall.java
├── notifications/
│   ├── Notifiable.java
│   ├── EmailNotification.java
│   ├── SMSNotification.java
│   └── ReminderService.java
└── Main.java
Step 4: Write the Code
Copy the Java classes from the previous answer into their respective files.

For example, EmailNotification.java goes into the notifications folder.

Use proper package declarations in each file. For example:

java
package notifications;
public class EmailNotification implements Notifiable { ... }
Step 5: Compile and Run
Compile:

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+).

Navigate to the src directory:

bash
cd src
Compile all Java files:

bash
javac -d ../out Main.java
Run:

bash
java -cp ../out Main
Step 6: Testing in VS Code
Use the Run and Debug feature in VS Code:

Open Main.java.

Click the Run button (▶️) in the top-right corner.

VS Code will automatically compile and run the code.

Example Output (for testing):

Email sent to emergency@example.com: Critical heart rate: 120
SMS sent to emergency@example.com: Critical heart rate: 120
Email sent to emergency@example.com: PANIC BUTTON PRESSED!
SMS sent to emergency@example.com: PANIC BUTTON PRESSED!
[Chat] Patient: Hello, I need help.
[Chat] Doctor: Please check your vitals.
Video call started: https://meet.example.com/6d3b4f7a-2c1d-4e5f-a8b9-0c7d6e8f5a2b
Step 7: Version Control (GitHub)
Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

bash
git init
Commit your code:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for Remote Health Monitoring System"
Create a GitHub repository and push your code:

bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
Step 8: Create README.md
Add a README.md file to your project with instructions:

markdown
# Remote Health Monitoring System

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RemoteHealthMonitoring.git
Open the project in VS Code.

Compile and run Main.java using the VS Code Run button or terminal commands.

Dependencies
Java JDK 17+

VS Code with Java Extension Pack

### **Step 9: Capture Screenshots**
1. Use VS Code’s **built-in terminal** to test scenarios:
   - Adding patients
   - Scheduling appointments
   - Triggering emergency alerts
   - Sending chat messages
2. Take screenshots of the console output for your Word document.

---

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Class Not Found Error**: Ensure your `src` directory structure matches the package declarations.
- **JDK Not Configured**: Set the Java home path in VS Code:
  - Go to `File → Preferences → Settings` → Search for "Java Home" → Add your JDK path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).

This setup ensures your Remote Health Monitoring System runs smoothly in VS Code while meeting all assignment requirements!
